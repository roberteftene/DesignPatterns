# Abstract Factory Pattern

### Intent

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
specifying their concrete classes.

Also known as **kit**.

### Motivation

Consider a user interface toolkit that supports multiple look-and-feel standards,
such as Motif and Presentation Manager. Different look-and-feels define different
appearances and behaviors for user interface "widgets" like scroll bars, windows,
and buttons. To be portable across look-and-feel standards, an application should
not hard-code its widgets for a particular look and feel. Instantiating
look-and-feel-specific classes of widgets throughout the application makes it
hard to change the look and feel later.


We can solve this problem by defining an abstract WidgetFactory class that declares
an interface for creating each basic kind of widget. There's also an abstract
class for each kind of widget, and concrete subclasses implement widgets for
specific look-and-feel standards. WidgetFactory's interface has an operation that
returns a new widget object for each abstract widget class. Clients call these
operations to obtain widget instances, but clients aren't aware of the concrete
classes they're using. Thus clients stay independent of the prevailing look and
feel. 

### Applicability

Use the Abstract Factory pattern when

* a system be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented
* a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
* a family of related product objects is designed to be used together,and you need to enforce
this contraint.
* you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their
interfaces, not their implementations

### Components

* AbstractFactory (WidgetFactory per example)

    * declares an interface for operations that create abstract product objects.

* ConcreteFactory (MotifWidgetFactory, PMWidgetFactory per example)

    * implements the operations to create concrete product objects

* AbstractProduct (Window, Scrollbar per example)

    * declares an interface for a type of product object.
    
* ConcreteProduct (MotifWindow, MotifScrollBar per example)

    * defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory
    * implements the AbstractProduct interface.
    
* Client 
    
    * uses only interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes.
    
    
### Consequences

1. **It isolates concrete classes**.
The Abstract Factory pattern helps you control
the classes of objects that an application creates. Because a factory
encapsulates the responsibility and the process of creating product objects,
it isolates clients from implementation classes. Clients manipulate
instances through their abstract interfaces. Product class names are
isolated in the implementation of the concrete factory; they do not appear
in client code.  

2. **It makes exchanging product families easy**.
The class of a concrete factory
appears only once in an applicationâ€”that is, where it's instantiated. This
makes it easy to change the concrete factory an application uses. It can
use different product configurations simply by changing the concrete
factory. Because an abstract factory creates a complete family of products,
the whole product family changes at once. In our user interface example,
we can switch from Motif widgets to Presentation Manager widgets simply
by switching the corresponding factory objects and recreating the
interface. 

3. **It promotes consistency among products**.
When product objects in a family
are designed to work together, it's important that an application use
objects from only one family at a time. AbstractFactory makes this easy
to enforce. 

4. **Supporting new kinds of products is difficult.** Extending abstract factories
to produce new kinds of Products isn't easy. That's because the
AbstractFactory interface fixes the set of products that can be created.
Supporting new kinds of products requires extending the factory interface,
which involves changing the AbstractFactory class and all of its subclasses.
We discuss one solution to this problem in the Implementation section.
