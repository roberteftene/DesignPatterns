# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.

### Adapter

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes
work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Bridge

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### Composite

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients
treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Decorator

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators
provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. 

### Facade

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade
defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. 

### Flyweight

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
efficiently. 

### Proxy

Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access
to it.
