ACME Inc. is developing a software solution for a bank considering the following specifications.
All instances of the application use a single object that has the role of managing the bank's data
(name, address, current account number counter)

but also to generate one of the 2 different types of accounts that the bank
manages(CreditAccount and DebitAccount). Account generation
is done depending on the type of account, transmitted by a String parameter. The two bank
accounts implement the IContBancar interface that defines 2 mandatory methods:
transfer(IContBancar destination, double amount) and deposit(double
amount).

Now, the bank is in talks about a possible merger with another bank, FutureBank. One
requirement of the merger is the interconnection of the 2 software systems so that banking
operations (transfer and deposit) can be carried out through any interruptions. ACME Inc. must
provide a trial solution by integrating the current system in the FutureBank one. It is known that
in the FutureBank bank system the accounts implement the IBankAccount interface that defines
accountTransfer(IBankAccount account, double amount) method.
